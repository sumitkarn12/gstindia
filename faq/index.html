					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. What is the need for the Place of Supply of Goods and Services under GST?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. The basic principle of GST is that it should effectively tax the consumption of such supplies at the destination thereof or as the case may at the point of consumption. So place of supply provision determine the place i.e. taxable jurisdiction where the tax should reach. The place of supply determines whether a transaction is intra-state or inter-state. In other words, the place of Supply of Goods is required to determine whether a supply is subject to SGST plus CGSTin a given State or else would attract IGST if it is an inter-state supply.

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. Why are place of supply provisions different in respect of goods and services?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. Goods being tangible do not pose any significant problems for determination of their place of consumption. Servicesbeingintangibleposeproblemsw.r.tdetermination of place of supply mainly due to following factors: The manner of delivery of service could be altered easily. For example telecom service could change from mostly post-paid to mostly pre-paid; billing address could be changed, billers address could be changed, repair or maintenance of software could be changed from onsite to online; banking services were earlier required customer to go to the bank, now the customer could avail service from anywhere; Service provider, service receiver and the service provided may not be ascertainable or may easily be suppressed as nothing tangible moves and there would hardly be a trail;For supplying a service, a fixed location of service provider is not mandatory and even the service recipient may receive service while on the move. The location of billing could be changed overnight;Sometime the same element may flow to more than one location, for example, construction or other services in respect of a railway line, a national highway or a bridge on a river which originate in one state and end in the other state. Similarly a copy right for distribution and exhibition of film could be assigned for many states in single transaction or an advertisement or a programme is broadcasted across the country at the same time. An airline may issue seasonal tickets, containing say 10 leafs which could be used for travel between any two location in the country. The card issued by Delhi metro could be used by a person located inNoida, or Delhi or Faridabad, without the Delhi metro being able to distinguish the location or journeys at the time of receipt of payment; Services are continuously evolving and would thus continue to pose newer challenges. For example 15-20 years back no one could have thought of DTH, online information, online banking, online booking of tickets, internet, mobile telecommunication etc.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. What proxies or assumptions in a transaction can be used to determine the place of supply?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. The various element involved in a transaction in services can be used as proxies to determine the place of supply. An assumption or proxy which gives more appropriate result than others for determining the place of supply, could be used for determining the place of supply. The same are discussed below:location of service provider;the location of service receiver;the place where the activity takes place/ place of performance;the place where it is consumed; andthe place/person to which actual benefit flows</div>

					<div class="w3-padding">A. InrespectofB2Btransactions,thetaxespaidaretaken as credit by the recipient so such transactions are just pass through. GST collected on B2 B supplies effectively create a liability for the government and an asset for the recipient of such supplies in as much as the recipient is entitled to usethe input tax credit for payment of future taxes. For B2B transactions the location of recipient takes care in almost all situations as further credit is to be taken by recipient. The recipient usually further supplies to another customer. The supply is consumed only when a B2B transaction is further converted into B2C transaction. In respect of B2C transactions, the supply is finally consumed and the taxes paid actually come to the government.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. What is the genesis of GSTN?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. The GST System Project is a unique and complex IT initiative. It is unique as it seeks, for the first time to establish a uniform interface for the tax payer and a common and shared IT infrastructure between the Centre and States. Currently, the Centre and State indirect tax administrations work under different laws, regulations, procedures and formats and consequently the IT systems work as independent sites. Integrating them for GST implementation would be complex since it would involve integrating the entire indirect tax ecosystem so as to bring all the tax administrations (Centre, State and Union Territories) to the same level of IT maturity with uniform formats and interfaces for taxpayers and other external stakeholders. Besides, GST being a destination based tax, the inter- state trade of goods and services (IGST) wouldneed a robust settlement mechanism amongst the States and the Centre. This is possible only when there is a strong IT Infrastructure and Service back bone which enables capture, processing and exchange of information amongst the stakeholders (including taxpayers, States and Central Government, Bank and RBI)This aspect was discussed in the 4th meeting of 2010 of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers held on 21/7/2010. In the said meeting the EC approved creation of an ‘Empowered Group on IT Infrastructure for GST’ (referred as EG) under the chairmanship of Dr. Nandan Nilekani along with Additional Secretary (Rev), Member (B &amp;C) CBEC, DG (Systems), CBEC, FA Ministry of Finance, Member Secretary EC and five state commissioners of Trade Taxes (Maharashtra, Assam, Karnataka, West Bengal and Gujarat). The Group was mandated to suggest, inter alia, the modalities for setting up a National Information Utility (NIU/ SPV) for implementing the Common Portal to be called GST Network (GSTN) and recommend the structure and terms of reference for the NIU/ SPV, detailed implementation strategy and the road map for its creation in addition to other items like training, outreach etc.In March 2010, TAGUP constituted by the Ministry of Finance had recommended that National Information Utilities should be set up as private companies with a public purpose for implementation of large and complex Government IT projects including GST. Mandate of TAGUP was to examine the technological and systemic issuesrelating to the various IT projects such as GST, TIN, NPS, etc.The EG had seven meetings between 2nd August 2010 and 8th August 2011 to discuss the modalities. After due deliberations, the EG recommended creation of a Special Purpose Vehicle for implementing the GST System Project. To enable efficient and reliable provision of services in a demanding environment, the EG recommended a non- Government structure for the GSTN SPV with Government equity of 49% (Centre – 24.5% and States – 24.5%) after considering key parameters such as independence of management, strategic control of Government, flexibility in organizational structure, agility in decision making and ability to hire and retain competent human resources.In view of the sensitivity of the role of GSTN and the information that would be available with it, the EG also considered the issue of strategic control of Government over GSTN. The Group recommended that strategic control of the Government over the SPV should be ensured through measures such as composition of the Board, mechanisms of Special Resolution and Shareholders Agreement, induction of Government officers on deputation, and agreements betweenGSTNSPVandGovernments.Also,theshareholding pattern would ensure that the Centre individually and States collectively are the largest stakeholders at 24.5% each. In combination, the Government shareholding at 49% would far exceed that of any single private institution.EG also brought out the need to have technology specificationtorunthiscompanysothatthereis100percent matching of returns. The business knowledge resides with the officials of Government of India and States. However, professionals with sophisticated technology knowledge will be required to run this company independently, similar to NSDL which is working professionally and independently. EG also recommended a non-government company as that will have operational freedom. These recommendations were presented before the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers in its 3rd meeting of 2011 held on 19th August 2011 and in the 4th meeting of 2011 of the EC held on 14th Oct 2011. The proposal of the EG on IT infrastructure for GST regarding GSTN and formation of a non-profit section 25 company with the strategic control with the Government were approved by the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers (EC) in its meeting held on14.10.11. The note of Department of Revenue for setting up a Special Purpose Vehicle to be called Goods and Services Tax Network on the lines mentioned above was considered by the Union Cabinet on 12th April 2012 and approved. The Union cabinet also approved the following: Suitableandwillingnon-governmentinstitutions will be identified and firmed up by the Ministry of Finance to invest in GSTN-SPV prior to its incorporation. The strategic control of the Government over the SPV would be ensured through measures such as composition of the Board, mechanisms of Special Resolution and ShareholdersAgreement, induction of Government officers on deputation, and agreements between GSTN SPV and Governments.The Board of Directors of GSTN SPV would comprise 14 Directors with 3 Directors from the Centre, 3 from the States, a Chairman of theBoard of Directors appointed through a joint approval mechanism of Centre and States, 3 Directors from private equity stake holders, 3 independent Directors who would be persons of eminence and a CEO of the GSTN SPV selected through an open selection process.Relaxation in relevant rules to enable deputation of Government officers to the GSTN SPV for exercise of strategic control and for bringing in necessary domain expertise.GSTN SPV would have a self- sustaining revenue model, where it would be able to levy user charges on the tax payers and the tax authorities availing services.GSTN SPV to be the exclusive national agency responsible for delivering integrated indirect Tax related services involving multiple tax authorities. Accordingly, any other service provider seeking to deliver similar integrated services would be required to enter into a formal arrangement with GSTN SPV for the services.A one- time non- recurring Grant- in aid of Rs.315 crore from the Central Government towardsexpenditure for the initial setting up and functioning of the SPV for a three year period after incorporation. In compliance of the Cabinet decision, GST Network was registered as a not-for-profit, private limited company under section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956 with the following equity structure: The GSTN in its current form was created after taking after approval of Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers and Union Government after due deliberations over a long period of time.</div>

Whereas in case of GST portal, another set of exercise manually or otherwise will have to be done to upload the invoice data or the return. The interface and features exposed by GST portal will be uniform for all taxpayers and might be basic in form and design. On the other hand GSPs are expected to have richer interfaces and features required by specific group (large taxpayers with completely automated financial system,SME with semi-automated system and small size with no system) of taxpayers. Also, by sheer size the GST portal will not be as nimble as that provided by a GSP. GSPs can come up with application to provide GST filing facility in existing software or develop end-to-end solution for SME and small taxpayer to manage their sale/purchase and GST filing e.g. an offline utility like spread sheet, which taxpayer can fill their invoice details and then upload on GST portal for processing. Similarly, for Tax Consultants (TC), GSPs can provide dashboard to display list of his/her all clients and clicking on a particular client can give TC the snapshot of the actions/ pending actions by client. GSPs can provide innovative/value added features, which would distinguish them with other GSPs in the market.http://www.gstn.org/ecosystem/faq_question.php</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. What are the basic requirements to be observed during Search operations?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. The following principles should be observed during Search:No search of premises should be carried out without a valid search warrant issued by the proper officer.There should invariably be a lady officer accompanying the search team to residence. The officers before starting the search should disclose their identity by showing their identity cards to the person in-charge of the premises. The search warrant should be executed before the start of the search by showing the same to the person in-charge of the premises and his signature should be taken on the body of the search warrant in token of having seen the same. The signatures of at least two witnesses should also be taken on the body of the search warrant. The search should be made in the presence of at least two independent witnesses of the locality. If no such inhabitants are available/willing, the inhabitants of any other locality should be asked to be witness to the search. The witnesses should be briefed about the purpose of the search. Before the start of the search proceedings, the team of officers conducting the search and the accompanying witnesses should offer themselves for their personal search to the person in-charge of the premises being searched. Similarly, after the completion of search all the officers and the witnesses should again offer themselves for their personal search. A Panchnama / Mahazar of the proceedings of the search should necessarily be prepared on the spot. A list of all goods, documents recovered and seized/detained should be prepared and annexed to the Panchnama/Mahazar. The Panchnama / Mahazar and the list of goods/ documents seized/detained should invariably be signed by the witnesses, the in-charge/ owner of the premises before whom the search is conducted and also by the officer(s) duly authorized for conducting the search. After the search is over, the search warrant duly executed should be returned in original to the issuing officer with a report regarding the outcome of the search. The names of the officers who participated in the search may also be written on the reverse of the search warrant.The issuing authority of search warrant should maintain register of records of search warrant issued and returned and used search warrants should be kept in records.A copy of the Panchnama / Mahazar along with its annexure should be given to the person in- charge/owner of the premises being searched under acknowledgement.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. Can a CGST/SGST officer access business premises under any other circumstances?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. Yes. Access can also be obtained in terms of Section 64 of MGL. This provision of law is meant to allow an audit party of CGST/SGST or C &amp;AG or a cost accountant or chartered accountant nominated under section 50 of CGST/SGST Act, access to any business premises without issuance of a search warrant for the purposes of carrying out any audit, scrutiny, verification and checks as may be necessary to safeguard the interest of revenue. However, a written authorization is to be issued by an officer of the rank of Additional/Joint Commissioner of CGST or SGST. This provision facilitates access to a business premise which is not registered by a taxable person as a principal or additional place of business but has books of accounts, documents, computers etc. which are required for audit or verification of accounts of a taxable person.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. When is search said to be illegal? Is evidence collected in the course of an illegal search admissible in trial proceedings?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. Search without a valid search warrant (i.e. issued by other than a competent authority or without a search warrant) results in an illegal search without authority of law. However, due to this reason, the accused cannot get benefit.

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. What is meant by the term ‘Seizure’?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. The term ‘seizure’ has not been specifically defined in the Model GST Law.

It generally implies taking possession forcibly contrary to the wishes of the owner of the property or who has the possession and who was unwilling to part with the possession.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. Does MGL have any power of detention of goods and conveyances?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. Yes, under Section 69 of MGL, an officer has power to detain goods along with the conveyance (like a truck or other types of vehicle) transporting the goods. This can be done for such goods which are being transported or are stored in transit in violation of the provisions of MGL. Goods which are stored or are kept in stock but not accounted for can also be detained. Such goods and conveyance can be released after payment of applicable tax or upon furnishing security of equivalent amount.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. What is the distinction in law between ‘Seizure’ and ‘Detention’?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. Denial of access to the owner of the property or the person who possesses the property at a particular point of time by a legal order/notice is called detention. Seizure is taking over of actual possession of the goods by the department. Detention order is issued when it is suspected that the goods are liable to confiscation. Seizure can be made only on the reasonable belief which is arrived at after inquiry/investigation that the goods are liable to confiscation.</div>

In other words a person is said to be arrested when he is taken and restrained of his liberty by power or colour of lawful warrant.</div>

Within this period, as provided under section 56 of Cr.P.C., the person making the arrest shall send the person arrested without warrant before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case.In a landmark judgment in the case of D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal reported in 1997 (1) SCC 416, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has laid down specific guidelines required to be followed while making arrests. While this is in relation to police, it needs to be followed by all departments having power of arrest. These are as under:The police personnel carrying out the arrest and handling the interrogation of the arrestee should bear accurate, visible and clear identification and name tags with their designations. The particulars of all such police personnel who handle interrogation of the arrestee must be recorded in a register.The police officer carrying out the arrest shall prepare a memo of arrest at the time of arrest and such memo shall be attested by at least one witness, who may be either a member of the family of the arrestee or a respectable person of the locality from where the arrest is made.

Any proceeding before it shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding under section 193 and 228 and for the purpose of section 196, of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The Settlement Commission also has the power to regulate its own procedure.Section 193 of IPC, 1860 contains penal provision for giving false evidence during the proceedings and section 228 of IPC, 1860 contains penal provisions for intentionally insulting or interrupting the Officer sitting in settlement proceedings. Accordingly these provisions of IPC can be invoked where the person gives false evidence or interrupts the proceedings of the Settlement Commission.Section 24 of the IGST Act gives power to Settlement Commission to amend its order to rectify any mistake apparent from the record within a period of three months from the date of the order. Such mistake may be noticed by the Settlement Commission on its own accord or may be brought to its notice by the applicant or the jurisdictional IGST officer. If a rectification has the effect of enhancing the tax liability or reducing the quantum of input tax credit, the applicant must be heard before the order is passed.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. Whether all invoices will have to be uploaded?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. No. It depends on whether B2B or B2C plus whether Intra-state or Inter-state supplies. For B2B supplies, all invoices, whether Intra-state or Inter- state supplies, will have to be uploaded. Why So? Because ITC will be taken by the recipients, invoice matching is required to be done. In B2C supplies, uploading in general may not be required as the buyer will not be taking ITC. However still in order to implement the destination based principle, invoices of value more than Rs.2.5 lacs in inter-state B2B supplies will have to be uploaded. For intra-state invoices below Rs. 2. lacs and all intra-state invoices, state wise summary will be sufficient.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. Whether description of each item in the invoice will have to be uploaded?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. No. In fact description will not have to be uploaded.

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. Can a recipient feed information in his GSTR-2 which has been missed by the supplier? Ans Yes, the recipient can himself feed the invoices not uploaded by his supplier. The credit on such invoices will also be given provisionally but will be subject to matching. On matching, if the invoice is not uploaded by the supplier, both of them will be intimated. If the mismatch is rectified, provisional credit will be confirmed. But if mismatch continues even after intimation, the credit provisionally allowed will be reversed.</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. While a large part of GSTR-2 will be auto-populated, there are some details that only recipient can fill like details of imports, details of purchases from non-registered or composition suppliers and exempt/non-GST/nil GST supplies etc.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. What if the invoices do not match? Whether ITC given or denied? If denied, what action is taken against supplier?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. If invoices in GSTR-2 do not match with invoices in counter-party GSTR-1, the ITC will be reversed if the mismatch continues even after it is made known to both and still it is not rectified. Mismatch can be because of two reasons. First, it could be due to mistake at the side of the recipient, and in such a case, no further action is required. Secondly, it could be possible that the said invoice was issued by supplier but he did not upload it and pay tax on it. In such a case, recovery action shall be taken against the supplier. In short, all mismatches will lead to proceedings if the supplier has made a supply but not paid tax on it.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. What will be the legal position in regard to the reversed input tax credit if the supplier later realises the mistake and feeds the information?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. At any stage, but before September of the next financial year, supplier can upload the invoice and pay duty and interest on such missing invoices in his GSTR-3 of the month in which he uploaded the invoice. The recipient will then automatically get ITC on that invoice. The interest paid by the recipient at the time of reversal will also be returned to the recipient through an automated system on the GSTN.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding">A. No. Composition tax payers do not need to file any statement of outward or inward supplies. They have to file a quarterly return in Form GSTR-4 by the 1st of the month after the end of the quarter. Since they are not eligible for any input tax credit, there is no relevance of GSTR-2 for them and since they do not pass on any credit to their recipients, there is no relevance of GSTR-1 for them. In their return, they have to declare summary details of their outward supplies along with the details of tax payment. They also have to give details of their purchases in their quarterly return itself, most of which will be auto populated.</div>

No, the ISDs need to file only a return in GSTR-6 and the return has the details of credit received by them from the service provider and the credit distributed by them to the subsidiaries.

Under GST, the deductor will be submitting the deductee wise details of all the deductions made by him in his return in Form GSTR-7 to be filed by 10th of the month next to the month in which deductions were made. The details of the deductions as uploaded by the deductor shall be auto populated in the GSTR-2 of the deductee. The taxpayer shall be required to confirm these details in his GSTR-2 to avail the credit for deductions made on his behalf. To avail this credit he does not require to produce any certificate in physical or electronic form. The certificate will only be for record keeping of the tax payer and can be downloaded from the Common Portal.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. If a return has been filed, how can it be revised if some changes are required to be made?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. In GST since the returns are built from details of individual transactions, there is no requirement for having a revised return. Any need to revise a return may arise due to the need to change a set of invoices or debit/ credit notes. Instead of revising the return already submitted, the system will allow changing the details of those transactions (invoices or debit/credit notes) that are required to be amended. They can be amended in any of the future GSTR- 1/2 in the tables specifically provided for the purposes of amending previously declared details.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. How can taxpayers file their returns?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. Taxpayers will have various modes to file the statements and returns. Firstly, they can file their statement and returns directly on the Common Portal online. However, this may be tedious and time taking for taxpayers with large number of invoices. For such taxpayers, an offline utility will be provided that can be used for preparing the statements offline after downloading the auto populated details and uploading them on the Common Portal. GSTN has also developed an ecosystem of GST Suvidha Providers (GSP) that will integrate with the Common Portal.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. What all should a diligent taxpayer ensure for a hassle free compliance under GST?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. One of the most important things under GST will be timely uploading of the details of outward supplies in Form GSTR-1 by 10th of next month. How best this can be ensured will depend on the number of B2B invoices that the taxpayer issues. If the number is small, the taxpayer can upload all the information in one go. However, if the number of invoices is large, the invoices (or debit/ credit notes) should be uploaded on a regular basis. GSTN will allow regular uploading of invoices even on a real time basis. Till the statement is actually submitted, the system will also allow the taxpayer to modify the uploaded invoices. Therefore, it would always be beneficial for the taxpayers to regularly upload the invoices. Last minute rush will make uploading difficult and will come with higher risk of possible failure and default. The second thing would be to ensure that taxpayers follow up on uploading the invoices of their inward supplies by their suppliers. This would be helpful in ensuring that the input tax credit is available without any hassle and delay. Recipients can also encourage their suppliers to upload their invoices on a regular basis instead of doing it on or close to the due date. The system would allow recipients to see if their suppliers have uploaded invoices pertaining to them. The GSTN system will also provide the track record about the compliance level of a tax payer, especially about his track record in respect of timely uploading of his supply invoices giving details about the auto reversals that have happened for invoices issued by a supplier. The Common Portal of GST would have pan India data at one place which will enable valuable services to the taxpayers. Efforts are being made to make regular uploading of invoices as easy as possible and it is expected that an enabling eco- system will develop towards this objective. Taxpayers should make efficient use of this ecosystem for easy and hassle free compliance under GST.</div>

Section 2(62) of the MGL provides that “job-work” means undertaking any treatment or process by a person on goods belonging to another registered taxable person and the expression “job-worker” shall be construed accordingly. This definition is much wider than the one given in Notification No. 214/86 – CE dated 23rd March, 1986 as amended, wherein job-work has been defined in such a manner so as to ensure that the activity of job-work must amount to manufacture. Thus the definition of job- work itself reflects the change in basic scheme of taxation relating to job-work in the proposed GST regime.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. What principles were adopted for subsuming the above taxes under GST?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. The various Central, State and Local levies wereexamined to identify their possibility of being subsumed under GST. While identifying, the following principles were kept in mind:Taxes or levies to be subsumed should be primarily in the nature of indirect taxes, either on the supply of goods or on the supply of services.Taxes or levies to be subsumed should be part of the transaction chain which commences with import/ manufacture/ production of goods or provision of services at one end and the consumption of goods and services at the other. The subsumation should result in free flow of tax credit in intra and inter-State levels. The taxes, levies and fees that are not specifically related to supply of goods &amp;services should not be subsumed under GST. Revenue fairness for both the Union and the States individually would need to be attempted.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. Why is Dual GST required?</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. Why was the Constitution of India amended recently in the context of GST?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. Currently, the fiscal powers between the Centre and the States are clearly demarcated in the Constitution with almost no overlap between the respective domains. The Centre has the powers to levy tax on the manufacture of goods (except alcoholic liquor for human consumption, opium, narcotics etc.) while the States have the powers to levy tax on the sale of goods. In the case of inter-State sales, the Centre has the power to levy a tax (the Central Sales Tax) but, the tax is collected and retained entirely by the States. As for services, it is the Centre alone that is empowered to levy service tax. Introduction of the GST required amendments in the Constitution so as to simultaneously empower the Centre and the States to levy and collect this tax. The Constitution of India has been amended by the Constitution (one hundred and first amendment) Act, 2016 recently for this purpose. Article 246A of the Constitution empowers the Centre and the States to levy and collect the GST.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. How a particular transaction of goods and services would be taxed simultaneously under Central GST(CGST) and State GST(SGST)?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. The Central GST and the State GST would be levied simultaneously on every transaction of supply of goods and services except the exempted goods and services, goods which are outside the purview of GST and the transactions which are below the prescribed threshold limits. Further,both would be levied on the same price or value unlike State VAT which is levied on the value of the goods inclusive of CENVAT. While the location of the supplier and the recipient within the country is immaterial for the purpose of CGST, SGST would be chargeable only when the supplier and the recipient are both located within the State. Illustration I: Suppose hypothetically that the rate of CGST is 10% and that of SGST is 10%. When a wholesale dealer of steel in Uttar Pradesh supplies steel bars and rods to a construction company which is also located within the same State for, say Rs. 100, the dealer would charge CGST of Rs. 10 and SGST of Rs. 10 in addition to the basic price of the goods. He would be required to deposit the CGST component into a Central Government account while the SGST portion into the account of the concerned State Government. Of course, he need not actually pay Rs. 20 (Rs. 10 + Rs. 10 ) in cash as he would be entitled to set-off this liability against the CGST or SGST paid on his purchases (say, inputs). But for paying CGST he would be allowed to use only the credit of CGST paid on his purchases while for SGST he can utilize the credit of SGST alone. In other words, CGST credit cannot, in general, be used for payment of SGST. Nor can SGST credit be used for payment of CGST. Illustration II: Suppose, again hypothetically, that the rate of CGST is 10% and that of SGST is 10%. When an advertising company located in Mumbai supplies advertising services to a company manufacturing soap also located within the State of Maharashtra for, let us say Rs. 100, the ad company would charge CGST of Rs. 10 as well as SGST of Rs. 10 to the basic value of the service. He would be required to deposit the CGST component into a Central Government account while the SGST portion into the account of the concerned State Government. Of course, he need not again actually pay Rs. 20 (Rs. 10+Rs. 10) in cash as it would be entitled to set-off this liability against the CGST or SGST paid on his purchase (say, of inputs such as stationery, office equipment, services of an artist etc). But for paying CGST he would be allowed to use only the credit of CGST paid on its purchase while for SGST he can utilise the credit of SGST alone. In other words, CGST credit cannot, in general, be used for payment of SGST. Nor can SGST credit be used for payment of CGST.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. What are the benefits which the Country will accrue from GST?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. Introduction of GST would be a very significant step in the field of indirect tax reforms in India. By amalgamating a large number of Central and State taxes into a single tax and allowing set-off of prior-stage taxes, it would mitigate the ill effects of cascading and pave the way for a common national market. For the consumers, the biggest gain would be in terms of a reduction in the overall tax burden on goods, which is currently estimated at 25%-30%. Introduction of GST would also make our products competitive in the domestic and international markets. Studies show that this would instantly spur economic growth. There may also be revenue gain for the Centre and the States due to widening of the tax base, increase in trade volumes and improved tax compliance. Last but not the least, this tax, because of its transparent character, would be easier to administer.</div>

The functions of the GSTN would, inter alia, include: (i) facilitating registration; (ii) forwarding the returns to Central and State authorities;computation and settlement of IGST; (iv) matching of tax payment details with banking network; (v) providing various MIS reports to the Central and the State Governments based on the tax payer return information;providing analysis of tax payers’ profile; and (vii) running the matching engine for matching, reversal and reclaim of input tax credit. The GSTN is developing a common GST portal and applications for registration, payment, return and MIS/ reports. The GSTN would also be integrating the common GST portal with the existing tax administration IT systems and would be building interfaces for tax payers. Further, the GSTN is developing back-end modules like assessment, audit, refund, appeal etc. for 19 States and UTs (Model States). The CBEC and Model I States (15 States) are themselves developing their GST back-end systems. Integration of GST front-end system with back-end systems will have to be completed and tested well in advance for making the transition smooth.</div>

					<div class="w3-padding w3-theme-l2">Q. What are the other legislative requirements for introduction of the GST?</div>
					<div class="w3-padding">A. Suitable legislation for the levy of GST (Central GST Bill, Integrated GST Bill and State GST Bills) drawing powers from the Constitution would need to be passed by the Parliament and the State Legislatures. Unlike the Constitutional Amendment which requires 2/3rd majority, the GST Bills would need to be passed by a simple majority. Obviously, the levy of the tax can commence only after the GST law has been enacted by the Parliament and respective Legislatures.****Levy of and Exemptionfrom TaxLevy of and Exemption from Tax</div>
